# Step 06: Browser Back Button Navigation

## Summary
Migrated from state-based navigation to React Router v6. URL-based routing enables native browser back/forward buttons and shareable URLs.

## Key Changes
- Replaced `currentView` state with `<Routes>` and `<Route>` components
- Removed selected entity state (`selectedExerciseType`, etc.)
- Route wrapper components: use `useParams()` to fetch data, render pages, redirect if not found
- Navigation handlers use `navigate()` instead of state setters
- Drawers controlled by URL patterns (e.g., `/exercise-types/new`, `/routines/:id/edit`)
- Browser back closes drawers (URL-based detection with `isDrawerOpen`, `getDrawerMode()`)
- Removed all explicit "< Back" buttons (rely on browser + breadcrumbs)

## Route Structure
```
/                                    - Home
/exercise-types                      - List
/exercise-types/new                  - Create (drawer)
/exercise-types/:id                  - Detail
/exercise-types/:id/edit             - Edit (drawer)
/exercise-types/:id/exercises/new    - Create Exercise (drawer)
/routines                            - List
/routines/new                        - Create (drawer)
/routines/:id                        - Detail
/routines/:id/edit                   - Edit (drawer)
/programs                            - List
/programs/new                        - Create (drawer)
/programs/:id                        - Detail
/programs/:id/edit                   - Edit (drawer)
/workout/active                      - Active Workout
```

## Benefits
- Native browser navigation
- Shareable URLs (including drawer states)
- Browser back closes drawers
- Cleaner UI (no redundant back buttons)
- URL as source of truth
